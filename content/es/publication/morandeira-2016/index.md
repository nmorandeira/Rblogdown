abstract: The inclusion of functional approaches on wetland characterizations and
  on biodiversity assessments improves our understanding of ecosystem functioning.
  In the Lower Paraná River floodplain, we assessed the ability of C-band polarimetric
  SAR data of contrasting incidence angles to discriminate wetland areas dominated
  by different plant functional types (PFTs). Unsupervised H/$α$ and H/A/$α$Wishart
  classifications were implemented on two RADARSAT-2 images differing in their incidence
  angles (FQ24 and FQ08). Obtained classes were assigned to the information classes
  (open water, bare soil and PFTs) by a priori labeling criteria that involved the
  expected interaction mechanisms between SAR signal and PFTs as well as the relative
  values of H and $α$. The product obtained with the shallow incidence angle scene
  had a higher accuracy than the one obtained with the steep incidence angle product
  (61.5% vs. 46.2%). We show how a systematic analysis of the H/A/$α$ space can be
  used to improve the knowledge about the radar polarimetric response of herbaceous
  vegetation. The map obtained provides novel ecologically relevant information about
  plant strategies dominating the floodplain. Since the obtained classes can be interpreted
  in terms of their functional features, the approach is a valuable tool for predicting
  vegetation response to floods, anthropic impacts
