abstract: Polarimetric soil moisture retrieval is among the main objectives of leading
  synthetic-aperture-radar satellite missions since it allows to systematically analyze
  costly-to-obtain polarization information to increase retrieval accuracy. In this
  letter, we present the results of modeling the L-band entropy (H) and alpha (��)
  values as a function of soil dielectric constant and roughness using a second-order
  small-perturbation model to simulate the polarimetric soil backscattering. Modeling
  results are then compared to bare soil uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture
  radar (UAVSAR) data acquired simultaneously to in situ field campaigns in Canada
  during SMAPVEx12. Our model is able to correctly predict observed ranges of H and
  �� and to consistently model dielectric constant and roughness changes. Nevertheless,
  a systematic overestimation of �� is observed when compared with the analyzed UAVSAR
  data set. Taking UAVSAR data as benchmark, theoretical reasons for this mismatch
  are analyzed.
