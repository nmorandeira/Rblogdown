abstract: 'Our aim was to assess whether plant trait values and functional types are
  associated with environmental features in floodplain wetlands. The study was conducted
  in the Lower Paraná River floodplain, mostly dominated by marsh communities. In
  72 sites, 16 functional traits were screened for 95 plant populations of 44 species.
  Since the interspecific variability in trait values resulted higher than the intraspecific
  variability, plant species (and not populations) were hierarchically classified
  into plant functional types (PFTs). Ten PFTs were identified. Two trade-offs were
  observed: resource acquisition vs. resource conservation or resource assignment
  to tissues conferring anoxia or salinity tolerance, and fast growth vs. light interception.
  Cover-abundance of the PFTs and community-level weighted means (CWMs) of the non-redundant
  traits were computed for 80 sites. Generalized linear models were used to assess
  the effect of environmental variables (landscape units, topographic positions, flooding
  frequency and eight soil variables) on the CWMs and on distribution of PFTs occurring
  in 15 sites or more. A two-stage modelling process was carried out to account for
  the presence-absence and cover-abundance of PFTs separately. The association between
  CWMs and environmental features was relatively weak but significant for six out
  of the eight traits analysed. Besides, satisfactory models were found for eight
  out of the nine PFTs assessed. In the studied floodplain, PFTs-interpreted in terms
  of life strategies-seem to be a better approach than CWMs to understand and characterise
  functional responses to the environment.'
