abstract: Unplanned urbanization increases the exposure of people to environmental
  hazards. Within a landscape ecology framework, this study is a diagnosis of human
  health risk in San Martín, an urban district of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Risk was
  estimated by combining four hazard indexes (water and air pollution, and mosquito
  and rodent infestation) and a vulnerability index. Each index was obtained by integrating
  environmental and socio-demographic layers in a Geographic Information System. Spatial
  autocorrelation was assessed for each hazard, vulnerability and risk indexes using
  Moran's tests. Also, spatial associations between pairs of variables were addressed
  by means of Geographically Weighted Regressions. The robustness of hazard and vulnerability
  indexes was checked by a sensitivity analysis. In General San Martń district, 83.3%
  of the population is exposed to relatively high levels of at least one hazard; 7.4%
  is exposed to relatively high levels of all hazards (11.5% of the total area) and
  only 16.7% lives in areas of relatively low levels of all hazards (15.4% of the
  total area). Areas where hazard intensity was relatively high corresponded to those
  areas where the most vulnerable population lives, enhancing human health risk. The
  models for hazards and vulnerability were reasonably robust to changes in the weights
  of the variables considered. Our results highlight the spatially heterogeneous nature
  of human health risk in an urban landscape, and reveal the location of critical
  risk hotspots where reduction or mitigation actions should be focused.
